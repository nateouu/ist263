        <h2>Buying and Selling Stocks</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 17px; text-align: center;" >Once you understand the different sectors and stocks you can invest in, the next step is buying and selling stocks. So how do you do this?</p>
        <img src="../images/usingstocks.jpg" alt="Understanding Using Stocks" class="orders-chart">


        <div class="trade-info">
            <div class="buying-info">
                <h3>Buying:</h3>
                <p>The easiest way to do this is through a brokerage account, which is like a bridge between you and the stock market. You deposit money into the account, then use it to purchase shares of companies you want to invest in. When you buy a stock, you're paying the current market price per share, and then you own a piece of that company.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="selling-info">
                <h3>Selling:</h3>
                <p>Selling works the same way in reverse, you tell your broker to sell your shares at either the current market price or at a set price you choose. The money from the sale goes back into your brokerage account, and you can either reinvest it or withdraw it. With online apps and websites, you can now buy and sell faster and more easily than ever before.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Market, Limit, and Stop Orders</h2>

        <p style="font-size: 17px; text-align: center;">Below is more detailed information about the types of buys and sells you can make when trading stocks. For convenience sake, it is typically easier to create a market order.</p>

        <div class="orders-and-video">
            <div class="order-types">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Market Order –</strong> Buy or sell a stock immediately at the best available current price. Fast but the price can fluctuate slightly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limit Order –</strong> Set a specific price you're willing to pay (buy) or accept (sell). The trade only happens if the stock reaches that price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stop Order (Stop-Loss Order) –</strong> Automatically sells a stock when it hits a certain price, helping limit losses if the stock drops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stop-Limit Order –</strong> Combines a stop order and a limit order: once the stop price is reached, it becomes a limit order to sell or buy at a specific price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trailing Stop Order –</strong> Sets a sell price at a fixed percentage or amount below the stock's highest price since you bought it, allowing you to lock in profits while limiting losses.</li>
                    <li><strong>All-or-None (AON) Order –</strong> Ensures that your entire order is executed at once; it won't partially fill.</li>
                    <li><strong>Good 'Til Canceled (GTC) Order –</strong> Remains active until it's executed or you cancel it (unlike a standard order that expires at the end of the trading day).</li>
                    <li><strong>Day Order –</strong> Only valid for the trading day; if it's not executed by the market close, it's canceled automatically.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
