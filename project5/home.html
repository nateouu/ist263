         <p>How Does the Stock Market Work?</p>

        <h1>So What is a Stock?</h1>
        <p>A stock represents a share of ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you own a piece of that business.</p>

        <p><strong>How Does it Work:</strong> If the company grows and becomes more valuable, the value of your share (the stock price) usually increases. There is also risk associated with stocks because if the company losses value, your stock may also lose value. Companies may also pay dividends (a portion of profits shared with stock holders).</p>

        <p><strong>Why Do People Buy Stocks:</strong> Historically the stock market has been on a upwards trend with an increase of 7–10% per year on average after inflation over the last century(what’s even better is that this is compound growth!). Since 1996, the S&P 500 (basket of 500 top companies in the US) has increased by 790%, a much higher return than what you’d get just getting compound interest at your bank. With stocks, you can grow your wealth faster to help reach goals like buying a house, retiring, and more. You are also able to create passive income with stocks through dividends.</p>

        <p><strong>What do people have to say about investing?</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Jet:</strong> If money just sits in a bank account, it barely grows, but when you invest, you give it the chance to multiply and open doors for your future. The earlier you start, the more time you have for your money to work for you, compounding and snowballing into something much bigger than what you put in later down the road. It gives me an account I can lean back on in times of emergency, helping me feel more secure about my finances.</p>
        
        <p><strong>John:</strong> Honestly, I know investing feels risky, and it’s normal to be nervous about it. Everyone worries about losing money at first. The good news is you don’t have to invest everything all at once. Start small, learn over time, be consistent, and let time do the rest.</p>

        <p><strong>Where Do You Buy Stocks:</strong> Stocks are traded on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ, where buyers and sellers set prices based on supply and demand. You as an individual are able to participate in these exchanges through brokerage firms like Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, Robinhood, and more. </p>
