    <title>Nate Ou- Bio</title>
</head>

<body>
    My name is Nate Ou. I’m a dual economics and data analytics student with a general interest in the macroeconomy and how policy impacts markets and looking at the data that plays into that. I recently passed my SIE certification test and am capable of coding in R, SQL, and Python. In my free time I play a lot of volleyball and spikeball with friends, generally just staying active. I’m also a huge beach person, it’s probably my favorite place in the world and I grew up by one. Also, my favorite movie is Cars, if you haven’t watched it you should because it’s iconic.
