        <h1>Nathan's Biography</h1>

         <p><img src="../images/complete_me.jpg" alt="Image of me!" class="float-left" > My name is Nate Ou. I’m a dual economics and data analytics student with a general interest in the macroeconomy and how policy impacts markets and looking at the data that plays into that. I recently passed my SIE certification test and am capable of coding in R, SQL, and Python. </p>

        <!--This is a comment, it won't display. -->
   <p>In my free time I play a lot of volleyball and spikeball with friends, generally just staying active. I’m also a <strong>huge</strong> beach person, it’s probably my favorite place in the world and I grew up by one. Also, my favorite movie is Cars, if you haven’t watched it you should because it’s iconic. </p>
